# :movie_camera: Quotatious

A minimalist app testing your cinema culture. Based on Next.js.

## :white_check_mark: Todo

- [ ] add more quotes to the database

## :construction: Stack

This project is powered by NextJS and nothing else. The database is for now a simple JSON file as there are, for now, only about 100 quotes. If I decide to add thousands more quotes or add the possibility to add a quote from a UI interface, I'll think about adding a real database.
