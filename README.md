## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Where does the idea come from?

Believe me or not, it took me 10 years do build this single page application... I tried to combine so many features but it never properly worked or it didn't make much sense. So I went back to the original idea: displaying random quotes with 2 bug buttons to display the answer and move to the next quote.

## üìö How to contribute?

I haven't written any _How to contribute_ guidelines but if you're interested in improving this project, just shout me a message! There are so many features and improvements to implement. Here are a few that I have in mind:

- [ ] display 4 potential answers for a quote and let the user pick one
- [ ] compute a score based on the user's answers
- [ ] better track how many sessions have been done
- [ ] add more quotes to the database. This will never end!

## üë®‚Äçüíª Stack

This project is powered by **[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)** and nothing else.

The **database is a simple JSON file** as there are, for now, only about 100 quotes. If I decide to add thousands more quotes or add the possibility to add a quote from a UI interface, I'll think about adding a real database.

The continuous integration job is done by **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/litil/quotatious/tree/master)**.

The site is hosted on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/guillaumeplambert/quotatious/deployments)**. No specific configuration required.
